1. Tortillas – I like to make soft tacos, so I start with corn tortillas, flour tortillas, or a corn and flour blend. If I’m lucky, I have a batch of freshly-cooked homemade tortillas on hand! Always char your tortillas on the stove or warm them in the oven before you fill them.

2. A base – Choose roasted or grilled veggies, a protein, or a grain. Some of my favorites include baked tofu, cooked black beans, cilantro lime rice or quinoa, or the veggie taco “meat” from this taco salad recipe. No matter what you pick, make sure to season it! Chili powder and/or cumin, salt, lime juice, and olive oil are a great place to start.

3. A sauce: No good vegetarian tacos are complete without a yummy sauce! Here are a few of my favorites:

Cilantro Lime Dressing
Chipotle Sauce
Tomatillo Salsa
Pico De Gallo
Mango Salsa
Pineapple Salsa
Guacamole
4. Flavorful extras: Pick garnishes that will contrast with your taco filling – something creamy, something fresh, something tangy, or something for crunch. My go-tos include sliced avocado, shredded cabbage, cilantro, crumbed Cotija or feta cheese, pickled jalapeños, pickled red onions, scallions, and cashew sour cream.

Serve your tacos with lime wedges for squeezing, pour a margarita or paloma, and enjoy!
